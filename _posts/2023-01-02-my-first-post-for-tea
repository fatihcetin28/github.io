This post is meant to summarize some of the key concepts I have learned in the course *Introduction to Python*

1.I created a GitHub account

2.I forked a repository from https://github.com/datamaunz

3.I renamed the forked repository tea-berlin.github.io

4.I edited the files as described in the README.md

5.Now I am writing my first post by following the advice that I got from the README file
